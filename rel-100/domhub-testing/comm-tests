FIXME: add names of scripts, required outputs, requirement
for pass...

wiggle: large wiggles on domA DAC, tests dor/dom state machine robustness.
make sure the dac stops wiggling for 100ms every 2 seconds so that hw does
not give up.

echo: stuffing echo test: check throughput, tests sw buffering, fw state
machine, hw via acceptable crc error rates

echo-throttle: echo test with read throttling on dor side: test dom/dor retx 
mechanism -- dom/dor stuck rx mechanism

sink: test dor write flow control -- small packets 64 bytes.  the
dom just sinks data -- check throughput crc errors and retx's.

source: test dom write flow control

wr-block: test dor write flow control, dor data flushing...

fpga-reload: fpga reload test: test reboot grant/request

softboot: test softboot, reboot grant/request

domid: test domid functionality

tcal: test round trip time and rms

slow-open: IC/CI test: test open/close on driver and iceboot->echo-mode,
ensure connection is asserted within x seconds...

quiet: make sure quiet, open dom does not pick
up any spurious packets

15) [from john] would like to see an open/close test run 1000 times or 
more to test for memory leaks as part of MJB ... didn't see the # in 
your list comm-tests.  NOT DONE YET

current: [from john] dom current readout for 1 or both doms on
a pair.

temp: temperature test, just records temperature data.

tests should be randomly assigned doms, all doms should
be busy all the time over the course of the test.  the
tests should run at -50C and a few other temperatures as
well, if possible (a ramp would be best)...
